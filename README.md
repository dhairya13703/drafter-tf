# uninstance

Run nested VMs on cloud providers that don't support nested virtualization.

## Overview

uninstance ("universal instance") manages instances that can run virtualization-enabled VMs across cloud providers through a single interface without needing emulation, nested virtualization or bare metal instances thanks to [PVM](https://github.com/virt-pvm/) and [Drafter](https://github.com/loopholelabs/drafter).
